    "changelog": "### Changed\n- Project-Wide Input Actions support can no longer be compiled out (removed the `UNITY_INPUT_SYSTEM_PROJECT_WIDE_ACTIONS` define). (ISX-2397)\n- Removed code that had to do with Unity versions older than Unity 2022.3 LTS. (ISX-2396)\n- Auto-save on focus lost can no longer be compiled out (ISX-2397)\n- Deprecated the `USE_IMGUI_EDITOR_FOR_ASSETS` feature option (ISX-2397)\n\n### Fixed\n- An issue where a UITK MouseEvent was triggered when changing from Scene View to Game View in the Editor has been fixed. [ISXB-1671](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1671)\n- Fix documentation error in file AndroidGameController.cs mentioning a wrong controller. [DOCATT-9806]\n- Deferred auto-registration of processors, interactions and composite binding types referenced by `InputActionAsset`\n  to only happen once when an unresolved type reference is found in an action definition. This avoids reflective\n  type loading from assemblies for all cases where the Input System is not extended. (ISXB-1766)."
