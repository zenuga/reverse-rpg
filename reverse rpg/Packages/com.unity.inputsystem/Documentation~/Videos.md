# Videos

This page provides a collection of video resources to introduce the Input System in Unity 6. Follow the videos in the order provided, since many of the tutorials provide a foundation for understanding the more advanced tutorials.

The Input System supports several different workflows, each with its own advantages. These videos walk you through the most commonly used workflows and offer practical guidance to help you begin using the Input System right away.


## Introduction to the Unity Input System

**Description**: This is the first video in a 7-part series that demonstrates how to get started with Unity’s Input System and introduces some of its core concepts. It covers the following lessons:

- Learn how to install the Input System in your Unity project.
- Understand the concept of input actions.
- Learn how to use the **Input Actions Editor** to bind input actions to various inputs, such as keys, gamepad buttons, and mouse axes.
- Explore how to define interactions when an input action is triggered (for example, press, hold, or release).
- Learn how processors can modify or transform raw input data before it’s used (for example, normalizing, inverting, or clamping values).
